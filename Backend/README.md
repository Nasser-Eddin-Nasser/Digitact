# Backend Server (Restful API server)

Console application that manage the access to the database and the CRUD operations in the database.

## Development

The following tools were used for development.
- JDK 11+ (Java Development Kit 11+)
- IDE: Eclipse or IntelliJ 
- Java Framework: Springboot
- Gradle 6.5
- Postman: Generate JSON requests (for testing purposes)
- PostgreSQL: Data storage
- pgAdmin4: Admin console for PostgreSQL
- Docker: Contains image of postgresql and pgAdmin4

## Java Development Kit(JDK)
It is recommended to use JDK 11+.
Download and [install JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

> Important: Make sure to [set up the environment variables](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml).

## IDE: Eclipse or IntelliJ
We recommend using one of the following IDEs:
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/luna/sr2/eclipse-ide-java-developers): Eclipse IDE for Java Developers 
- [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows): Community, Education or Ultimate edition. Important: Use version 2020.1 or later!

## Gradle
We use gradle as a build tool
[Download](https://gradle.org/releases/) gradle

## Postman (optional)
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) is a tool to create GET/POST/... requests. We recommend using it in order to debug the API.

## Docker

We use Docker to run our development database.
- [Download](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) for Windows 
- [Download](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) for Mac

## HTTPS Setup

We are using HTTPS for connection so its important to import and trust the certificate to run the application

- For mac - open keychain access file->import items-> choose keystore.p12 under /Backend/src/main/resources. Then double click on localhost and choose always trust option from the dialog. 
- For windows - double-click on keystore.p12 file under /Backend/src/main/resources and install it. 
- Password of certificate is "password"
- To trust localhost by chrome go to `chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost` and enable Allow invalid certificates for resources loaded from localhost option.

## How to use

- Install the below in-order
  - JDK 11+ and set environment variables
  - Install IDE and [set the JDK path](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html) if needed
  - Install Docker
- Clone this project
- Do HTTPS setup
- set configurations in Backend/ConfigProperties.java
- set `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto =``create-drop` or `update`  or `none` under /Backend/src/main/resource/application.properties
- Run `docker-compose up`
- Go to Digitact/Backend folder in the terminal and run `gradle bootrun`
    or
- Run the Digitact/Backend/Application.java file using your preferred IDE

## pgAdmin4

In order to view the content of the database, we ship pgAdmin4 with our docker-compose file. Open `localhost:8080` to open pgAdmin4. 

Log in using:
- Email Address: `example@example.com`
- Password: `example`


If you want to access the database, you are most likely prompted for a password. It is set to `postgres` by default.
