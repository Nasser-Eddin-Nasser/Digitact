Some elements from Ionic aren't directly placed in the ng template, but called inside the component's TS code.

An example is the Loading Controller.

Unfortunately, the texts that are displayed inside the elements are often only sanitized and not completely escaped. Because of this, user input (e.g. <b>Test</b>) can create unwanted behavior. It should not be possible to do XSS with this, but this depends on how safe Ionic's sanitization is.

To solve this issue, we introduce wrapper classes around the original ones. They have the same API as the original ones, but escape the input first.
